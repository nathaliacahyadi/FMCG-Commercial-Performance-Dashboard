# FMCG-Commercial-Performance-Dashboard
This project demonstrates how FMCG sales, budget, and promotional data can be transformed into insights for decision-making using Power BI. The dashboard focuses on revenue growth, margin drivers, promotional effectiveness, and scenario-based forecasting. Note that PNG files are available for preview of individual pages of the dashboard.

**Business Questions Addressed**:
- How is revenue and margin performance evolving over time versus budget?
- Which products and channels are most affected by promotions?
- Where does the business generate volume versus profitability?
- How could revenue change under different growth assumptions?
  

**Dashboard Structure**

*Page 1 — Executive Summary*

High-level KPIs including total revenue, gross margin, post-promotion margin, and budget variance, with monthly revenue vs budget comparison.

*Page 2 — Margin & Promotional Impact*

Product-level analysis of gross margin before and after promotions, supported by a margin bridge explaining how cost and promotions impact profitability.

*Page 3 — Channel Performance*

Comparison of revenue and post-promotion margin across channels (Grocery Retail, Wholesale, E-commerce), highlighting volume vs margin trade-offs.

*Page 4 — Forecast & Scenario Analysis*

Scenario-based revenue forecasting (Conservative, Base, Optimistic) using transparent growth assumptions to support planning discussions.


**Key Insights**
- Promotional activity impacts products unevenly: some categories absorb promotions with minimal margin erosion.
- Grocery Retail drives the majority of revenue but operates at lower margins, while E-commerce delivers higher margin at smaller scale.
- Actual revenue significantly outperformed budget in mid- and late-year months due to stronger-than-planned seasonality.
- Scenario analysis shows how modest changes in growth assumptions materially affect revenue outlook.

**Tools & Skills Used**
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards)
- DAX (KPIs, margin calculations, scenario logic)
- Commercial analytics & FP&A concepts (budgeting, margin analysis, promotional impact)
- Data modeling (star schema, fact/dimension tables)
